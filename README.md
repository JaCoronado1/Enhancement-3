## Overview

This repository documents the development of my ePortfolio for the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University. The purpose of this project is to showcase my growth, skills, and accomplishments as a software developer and computer science student. By curating key artifacts and enhancing them beyond course requirements, this ePortfolio serves as both a reflection of my academic journey and a professional showcase for potential employers.

The artifacts included demonstrate my proficiency in software engineering fundamentals, including relational database design, data structure implementation, and algorithmic problem-solving. Key projects include a SQL-based inventory management system and a custom-built algorithmic solution set designed to optimize application performance and computational logic.

Each component has been refined to meet real-world standards by addressing limitations, improving functionality, and ensuring code quality. This portfolio highlights my motivation, organizational strengths, and technical capabilities as I prepare to enter the software development field.
